# odin-recipes

This is my first new repository which I will actually work from. 

This new project will be to build a recipe website. 

By the end of this project I will have achieved the following:

-> Practise HTML
-> Increase my HTML coding speed
-> Become more experienced with Git/GitHub and VS Code
